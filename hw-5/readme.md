  For this assignment some animation was added into code, so I decided to make a car driving down the road. I sketched it all out before hand to make it easier to make the order of the shapes. I had Michael Musik's example open for reference to help me understand how everything worked. Before I tied the car to the mouse location I used translate() to move it to the center of the canvas, it was easier for me to construct that way. I did start off by placing the entire background with the setup function at first, forgetting that I needed it to be in draw, but then it was just a simple cut and paste. I also was having problems figuring out rotation speed. I liked in the homework example how the head rotation would change speeds, so I played around with that but I couldn't quite figure out how to regulate the speed.

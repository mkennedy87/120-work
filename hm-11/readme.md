HW 11 | Objects
For your homework this week you are to create a sketch and simple class that can create 10-40 objects that do something on the canvas.

Specification
The class you create should allow each object to have its own unique behavior. Additionally this class should have;

a constructor method that sets up all properties for new objects.
at least two other methods that cause these objects to do something on the screen.
In your setup() function, you should create the objects and add them to an array.

In your draw() function, you should call the appropriate methods on each object so they do something, whatever that thing is that they do.

As always, you should comment your code, write a readme, and provide links on the forum to both your git repo, and live sketch.

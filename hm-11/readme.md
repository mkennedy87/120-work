## Homework Week 11

This assignment I learned how to make classes and how to implement them in code. I spent a lot of time looking at the examples provided.  I also got lost  and probably made a bunch of nonsensical code. For some reason I could get the objects to stay bound to the canvas and also, the squares moved way too fast. Turns out for the speed I was using the wrong variables. To keep the objects bound to the canvas I didn't realize until looking at next weeks homework that I could just create a method to call upon. After I just moved the code to the new method it worked.
  I saw a classmate was having problems on github, but it was solved before I could come up with an answer for them.

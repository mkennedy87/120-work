## Project Proposal



What I want to do for my final project is to make a nature scene using a combonation of elements from p5 and png files.
In the sketch I want continuous clouds an array and for them  to scroll across the sky and I want to have an animated fire. I want to have a short animation of a guy poking his head out of the tent when it is clicked on. I want to make the sun change to white when the mouse hovers over it and I want to be able to drag the sun around in the background. While the sun is being dragged around I want the color of the sky to fade from pink to blue. I want to make some sort of obvious change to objects that can be interacted with when the mouse is dragged over them. If there's time, I want to make the camper flip pages when clicked on, and after that hopefully I can add a loop for sound.

I'd say the artists used for inspiration would be Mother Nature. That, and those old interactive screen savers that used to be around when I was a kid. There is also inspiration from the things that Shiffman created for us as examples.

The biggest problem I'm going to have is the little amount of time I have given to myself to do this project, but I know I can do it. Another thing that I haven't seen, or don't remember at least, is how to have colors fade, but as I'm writing this I'm starting to get an idea. I will need to get a better understanding of the math needed.

On friday 4/26 I'm going to have all the png files ready to go and hopefully start assembling the sketch. On Saturday 4/27 I want to have the animated elements completed and have the sun be able to be dragged around and figure out the clouds. On Sunday I will spend the day figuring out how to fade between colors and see just how much of the sketch I can affect with that. I hope that Monday I will be finished with what was proposed and then keep thinking of new things I can keep adding until I have to turn it in.

# Homework Week 12
This week I relied heavily on the examples provided in class to help me learn about objects interacting with each other. What I wanted the objects to do was to delete themselves when they ran into each other and then respawn. I couldn't quite hack it. I got up to the point of making them interact with eachother, but I couldn't figure out how to change the code into what I wanted. I do like the colors that I created in this. In order to get something turned in I decided to turn in a sketch that is very similar to what we've already been shown, rather than turning in a code that just didn't work. Another area I had trouble with was where all the objects spawed, I had a little grasp on it, but didn't totally understand why they all spawned at the top of the canvas. My assignment is far too late to be asking for help, so I won't be posting in github.

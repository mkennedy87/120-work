## Homework week 10




For this assignment ( I named it hw-9, but wasn't sure if it was actually supposed to be hw-10) I defined my own functions which really does make it easier to keep the code straight when reading through it. I also used an array for the first time. I built on top of an old assignment by converting a drawing into a function, and then created a second function for the speech balloon. After that, I created an array so that the drawing would cycle through text. I also changed the frame rate to 1 so the text was readable. I chose this drawing to reuse because it is my favorite that I have done in this class. I had to check comparing code with examples in this week's lesson and last weeks in order to complete the assignment. Can't say that I had any issues other than a brief mistake I made when declaring the array. It looks like there was an issue on github this week but I believe it is too late to join in the conversation.

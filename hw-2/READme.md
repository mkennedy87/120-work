## Homework assignment 2




This week I learned about markup and text editors. I chose to use atom as my text editor
because Mr. Musik is using this, and I feel it will just be easiest to use the exact same one.
This week I also learned about Github and set up a new account and repository. It's great that i
can network between my laptop and my desktop to complete assignments. I was actually having trouble
focusing on the text 2 part of the assignment so I actually typed the whole thing out instead
of copying and pasting it. I'm actually late to this assignment so I did not provide and wasn't
provided any help for this assignment.

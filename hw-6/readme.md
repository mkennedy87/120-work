## Homework Week 6


This week I made a ball travel across the canvas all the while leaving a trail behind it, while green dots randomly appeared on the screen. I had to make the majority of numbers into variables so that their value could be constantly changed, also I needed to add some random numbers and this allowed me to do so. I had a bunch of trouble keeping the red ball bound to the canvas which is weird because I had it figured out with week seven’s lecture examples. For some reason I found this assignment intimidating (which is why it’s late), which is also weird because I have always been fond of math. I am having a bit of trouble declaring my variables in the right place.
It has gotten a bit difficult for me to juggle all the variables but I'm sure with time I'll get it down. I didn't post my problems
 to the class repo tracker (I can be kind of stubborn), and none of the other students posted to it either.

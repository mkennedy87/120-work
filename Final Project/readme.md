## Final Project




So for my final project I may have been too ambitious. The thing I was most excited for was actually grabbing the sun and making the environment change color with it's position. I had to look through old class videos to find how to use the map function to get the sky change consistently. I actually didn't quite understand the use of the map function until now! I wanted to make the mountains change the same way the sky did, but even with google, I couldn't find a way for an image's alpha to change. I probably spent too much time making the images, but that's always where I have the most fun. I was getting frustrated with photoshop as it seemed to have trouble sorting things out and would repeatedly lock up on me.



  As of the time writing this, I am having trouble getting the animation to work. I've gone over the code at least 10 times and nothing is standing out to me as an error. I have 3 sprite animations planned but it's starting to look like they won't show up. I tried to get it to instead, cycle through an array hoping I could cheat it but that didn't do anything. I did get the mouse rollover to work where I intended which gave me actual joy. Another issue I had was the sound, I found a video by shiffman but when I entered the code, it broke my code.

  I did, finally, have an opportunity to help out on github, with one issue the people were having with uploading images. They were stuck with a perpetual loading screen, and I actually had this problem too. Turns out I forgot to run the local server, as soon as I did that I haven't had a problem embedding images onto the canvas. I let the others know.

  In the end I have the sun's position dictating the color of the sky to try and get that feel of a the time of day changing. I also have a cloud scrolling across the canvas so the image is not stagnant. The cloud will always respawn after it fully leaves the window. The image is interactive as you can drag the sun around and make a few of the objects glow. It might be just because I made it, but I really like the final product, though, I really do wish I could have at least got the fire to be animated.

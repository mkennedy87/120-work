Mike Kennedy
Week 8


  This homework cycle I learned more about for loops and how little code you need to fill a page. I kept forgetting to declare my variables before assigning value, and broke the code at least once. I drew my shapes first before declaring the variables just to make sure I got the shapes and sizes I wanted AND the starting points. I also wanted to use an if statement for the background color, and I could not figure out why I couldn't get it to update. I had it in my head that I should make the variables for the color, global variables, but I was convinced that I didn't need to. Turns out that I was wrong. No one has been posting issues to github, helping others really isn't an option.
